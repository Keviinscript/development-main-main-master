              You should seek advice from an independent and suitably licensed
              financial advisor and ensure that you have the risk appetite,
              relevant experience and knowledge before you decide to trade.

              unregulated services which are not governed by any specific
              European regulatory framework (including MiFID). Therefore when
              using our Cryptocurrencies Trading Service you will not benefit
              from the protections available to clients receiving MiFID

              copying or replicating the trades of other traders involves a high
              level of risks, even when following and/or copying or replicating
              the top-performing traders. Such risks includes the risk that you
              may be following/copying the trading decisions of possibly
              inexperienced/unprofessional traders, or traders whose ultimate
              purpose or intention, or financial status may differ from yours.
